# 2P-Match3
This is a 2 players match-3 game.

### Known issues
-> Some bomb-worthy moves aren't generating bombs (need to be mapped, but I recall this issue in some l-shapped matches).
-> Moving an opponent bomb directly ends up disabling the explosion (that's not expected lol).

### Next features
-> Turn timer.
-> Streak counter.
-> Lightning item.
-> Magnifying glass tip.
-> Nighty-night.
